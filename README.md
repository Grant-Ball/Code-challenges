# Code-challenges-201
created for Code Fellows ops 201

What is this repo all about?

  This repo contains all of my code challenges that I did throughout Ops 201 over a 3 week span.

Why are you learning these skills?

  These coding skills are very useful for learning how to control a computer through the command line or terminal depending on your operating system. Each of these challenges we have learned new commands that have the computer do different tasks on a Linux OS and a Microsoft OS.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

  We learned a lot about variables, functions, loops, and if statements while doing these code challenges. Near the end we learned more about networking and began to scratch the surface of pfsense.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

  My favorite code challenge was the if statement one because I feel like that was the first time that I attempted a code challenge all on my own and was able to come up with a working script on my own. That really gave me the confidence to know I would be able to learn anything that would be thrown at me in the future and that I wasn't learning nothing.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

  All the code challenges in this repository can show that I have the ability to write scripts that will perform a task whether it should be done automatically and triggered by something or if it should be manually implemented everytime it is needed. 

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

  If I had to choose one challenge to make better Iâ€™d be hard pressed to because I think I could really work on adding more explanation into all of my scripts so that if I came back to them years later and forgot something I would be able to walk myself through it with the challenge.

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

  I want to get better at learning and memorizing all of the basic commands for powershell and learn some more about the syntax of powershell. I am also excited to start learning python and to have the ability to effectively use it in a work environment.
